# OpenShift logging

Its an opinionated collector, normalizer and temporary store of
- *Application logs* : Container logs generated by user applications running in the cluster, except infrastructure container applications.

- *Infrastructure* : Container logs from pods that run in the openshift*, kube*, or default projects and journal logs sourced from node file system.

- *Audit* : Audit logs generated by the node audit system, auditd, Kubernetes API server, OpenShift API server, and OVN network.


It is intended to be used for forwarding logs to various supported systems. 


## Configuration

*Cluster Logging CR* : It defines the components to deploy such as vector
*Cluster Log Forwarder CR* : It defines which logs are collected and where logs are sent
*LokiStack* : It define the componets to deploy such as lokistack

## Troubleshooting

Each Custom resource has a status section that provides feedback about its current state. This information:

- The first place to investigate any deployment issue
- Includes known conditions specifically checked by each operator 
- May explicitly identify why the deployment may not be correct
- Provide information to determine why the deployment may not be correct

```bash
#  Provides summary information about the logging system deployment
 oc get clusterlogging instance -o yaml


# Provides detailed status information based on the operator verifying the correctness of inputs, outputs, and mappings
 oc get clusterlogforwarder -o yaml
```
